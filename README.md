# Pass the Glass

## Description

Pass the Glass is a user-friendly app designed to connect and encourage environmentally conscious citizens to recycle glass where pick up is not available. The site utilizes a local JSON database to provide full CRUD functionality using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS so that users may communicate where and when they require pickups.

## Features

* **Request Exploration**: Users may browse through a list of all recycling requests, where the day of the week and address is provided.
* **Advanced Filtering**: Pass the Glass offers filtering options so that users may narrow down their search based on the day of week and addresses of requested pickups to align location and scheduling.
* **Requests Management**: Users have the ability to make new pick-up requests, edit standing requests, and delete requests when pick-up is completed or offered to prevent miscommunication or overlap.
* **Profile Management**: Venue allows users to view and edit their profile information, allowing seamless transitions when life changes occur.
